# Current functionality

🟢 - working

🟠 - may need updating/configs

🔴 - patched/broken

*all* scripts are open source, and may include some extra functions (`event-egg.lua` will walk to the bubble-selling platform then to the event egg, you will also need to edit the egg hatching function as it is currently set to 200M Egg). This is just because these scripts are for my personal use.

`auto-claw-machine.lua` -- 🟠 works but may not collect all items

`cart-ride-pet-match.lua` -- 🟠 works, but you'll need to edit wait(x) to rotate evenly between the two minigames

`claim-chests.lua` -- 🟢 

`claim-playtime.lua` -- 🟢

`claim-season-pass.lua` -- 🟢

`event-egg.lua` -- 🟢 will walk to bubble selling platform first

`fast-open.lua` -- 🟢 spams r

`generic-fps-booster.lua` -- 🟠 idek

`hide-minigame-ui.lua` -- 🟢 works as intended but is basically useless

`season-pass-grinder.lua` -- 🟢 config is needed to change the default egg (the egg that you hatch when you are done with quests) it is currently set to Infinity Egg

`webhook.lua` -- 🟠 it works but config is needed to refine certain issues concerning multiple webhooks sending for the same pet
