# Current functionality

🟢 - working

🟠 - may need updating/configs

🔴 - patched/broken

*all* scripts are open source, and may include some extra functions (`event-egg.lua` will walk to the bubble-selling platform then to the event egg, you will also need to edit the egg hatching function as it is currently set to 200M Egg). This is just because these scripts are for my personal use.

`auto-claw-machine.lua` -- 🟠 works but may not collect all items [raw script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Boxes/BGSI/refs/heads/main/auto-claw-machine.lua)

`cart-ride-pet-match.lua` -- 🟠 works, but you'll need to edit wait(x) to rotate evenly between the two minigames [raw script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Boxes/BGSI/refs/heads/main/cart-ride-pet-match.lua)

`claim-chests.lua` -- 🟢 [raw script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Boxes/BGSI/refs/heads/main/claim-chests.lua)

`hide-minigame-ui.lua` -- 🟢 works as intended but is basically useless [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Boxes/BGSI/refs/heads/main/hide-minigame-ui.lua)

`season-pass-grinder.lua` -- 🟢 config is needed to change the default egg (the egg that you hatch when you are done with quests) it is currently set to Infinity Egg [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Boxes/BGSI/refs/heads/main/season-pass-grinder.lua)

`webhook.lua` -- 🟠 it works but config is needed to refine certain issues concerning multiple webhooks sending for the same pet [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Boxes/BGSI/refs/heads/main/webhook.lua)
